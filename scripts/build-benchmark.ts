/**
 * Build the classifier benchmark, once, by asking the real model real pages.
 *
 * The benchmark itself must run in CI on every push, and CI must not spend
 * money — so the live call happens here, by hand, and what it returns is stored
 * as a fixture. From then on `npm run test:benchmark` replays the stored
 * answers and costs nothing.
 *
 * That is a real trade and worth stating plainly: replaying fixtures tests that
 * the *pipeline* still turns a verdict into the right record, not that the
 * model still answers the same way. Model drift is caught by re-running this
 * script, not by CI. It should be re-run whenever the system prompt changes,
 * and the prompt's own hash is stored beside the answers so a stale benchmark
 * is visible rather than silently reassuring.
 *
 *   npm run build:benchmark            every case (costs money)
 *   npm run build:benchmark -- --only cyber_1
