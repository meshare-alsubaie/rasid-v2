/**
 * Check every candidate link, at the same bar as the hand rounds.

 * Forty-four organisations were checked by opening each page and reading it.
 * That does not scale to the rest, so this does the same job mechanically and,
 * in one way, more strictly: it reads the whole extracted text rather than what
 * an eye lands on, and it will not promote a link unless the page itself says
 * one of the accepted phrases. The phrase it found is stored, so every promoted
 * link still carries a quote anyone can check.
 *
 * What it cannot do is judge. A page that discusses cooperative training in
 * passing will pass this and would have failed a reading. That is why a promoted
 * link says which phrase was matched and where, and why nothing here touches
 * `manualCheckUrl`: the link the user taps still has to be earned by a person.
