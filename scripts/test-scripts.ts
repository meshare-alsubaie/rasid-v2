/**
 * The PowerShell entry points parse, and stay parseable.
 *
 * `scheduled-run.ps1` is how collection actually happens — the machine in
 * Riyadh is the only one that can reach most of these sites — and nothing in
 * the test suite ever looked at it. Two typographic dashes in a comment were
 * enough to stop it parsing, and the failure had the worst possible shape: the
 * task exited 1, nothing reached the log because the log is written from inside
 * the script, and the app went on showing a calm "checked N hours ago" while no
 * collection had run at all.
 *
 * Windows PowerShell 5.1 reads a `.ps1` with no byte-order mark in the system
 * codepage, so any character outside ASCII is a hazard rather than a style
 * choice. Both things are checked here: that the file parses, and that it
 * cannot acquire the characters that stop it parsing.
 *
 *   npm run test:scripts
