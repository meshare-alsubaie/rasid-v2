/**
 * Phase 2 collector: fetch every verified source, extract its readable text,
 * work out whether it changed, and record what happened to every one of them.
 *
 * The rule that shapes this file is spec section 0.3, fail loudly not silently.
 * A source that could not be fetched, or that robots.txt put out of reach, is
 * written into health.json as degraded or broken. It is never quietly dropped
 * to keep the dashboard green, because a stale green light is worse than a red
 * one for someone whose semester depends on catching a 7-day window.
 *
 * Only sources carrying `verifiedAtISO` are fetched. An unopened lead has not
 * been confirmed to be the page it claims to be, and the pipeline must not
 * spend requests, or the user's trust, on a guess.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   npm run collect                  every verified source
 *   npm run collect -- --limit 5     the acceptance run for this phase
 *   npm run collect -- --dry-run     fetch and report, write nothing
 *   npm run collect -- --verbose     one line per source
