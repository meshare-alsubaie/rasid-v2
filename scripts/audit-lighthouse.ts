 * the same bytes and the same code: Lighthouse throttles the CPU by a fixed
 * multiple, so a slow, contended host is measuring the host. Failing a deploy
 * on that number would block real work for a reason that has nothing to do with
 * the app, and a gate that fails for noise is a gate people learn to ignore.
 *
 * Accessibility is not like that — it is a static audit of the rendered page,
 * it scored 97 and 99 on the two machines, and it stays a hard gate in both
 * places. Performance is still printed in CI, and still enforced locally, which
 * is where a real regression will be caught before it ships.
