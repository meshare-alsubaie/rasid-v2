# Deferred

Everything here is known, reproduced, and deliberately not fixed.

The project stopped on a rule worth writing down: after the final report, a
defect that cannot silently cost a real opportunity is recorded and left. The
goal was never a perfect tool. It was a tool that does not let a window pass
unseen — and past that line, more work costs more than it returns.

Each entry says what it is, what it would cost, and — the part that decides
whether it stays here — what it would actually cost him if it is never fixed.

---

## Coverage

**One record per page.** A careers page listing four programmes yields one, and
hides three. Mitigated rather than fixed: the classifier reports `moreOnPage`
and the card says the page holds more, so he opens it himself. Fixing it
properly means letting one source produce several records, which changes how a
record is identified. *If never fixed: he sees one of several programmes on a
page, and is told so.*

**Ten organisations have no readable source.** `taqnia` and `derayah` paint
their pages with script and yield nothing even to a real browser; `devoteam_sa`
answers 403; `kasb` serves a broken certificate; `media.gov.sa` forbids every
crawler but the search engines in `robots.txt`, which is obeyed. Each carries
its reason in the app. *If never fixed: those ten need checking by hand, and
the app says which.*

**A window shorter than six hours is invisible.** Published and closed between
two rounds. The only remedy is a faster cadence. *If never fixed: an
announcement open for less than a working day could pass unseen — rare, and
unbounded only in theory.*

**Three decision fields are almost entirely unknown.** `requiresZeroCourses` is
known for one organisation in 115, `acceptsUserMajor` for three, `city` for
five. The filters work; there is little to filter. This is slow manual reading
with no shortcut. *If never fixed: the filters return short lists, and the
chips honestly say "unknown" rather than guessing.*

## The pipeline

**Seats, duration and cities still come from the model.** Dates were moved to a
calendar table because a wrong date costs a semester. These three are extracted
by the model and it has been seen to drop all three from a sentence it otherwise
read correctly. *If never fixed: a card occasionally omits a seat count the page
published.*

**`verify-leads` grades its own work.** It stamps `provenance: "official"` on
any page on the organisation's own domain that yields readable text. The narrower
claim — that the page is about cooperative training — is separated into
`coopConfirmed` and shown as such, but the stamp itself is automatic. *If never
fixed: "official" means less than a reader might assume, and the interface says
what it actually means.*

**Two collectors write to one branch.** The laptop and the runner each commit
`data/`. The push now rebases and retries three times, and fails loudly rather
than green. *If never fixed: a rare lost round, announced.*

**The runner's failures look like broken sources.** A collection from a United
States address cannot reach many `.gov.sa` hosts, so the four scheduled runs a
day degrade health for pages that are perfectly readable from Riyadh, and each
degradation can raise a "this source stopped" alarm for a source that did not.
Records are never deleted by it, and since the priority bands were fixed these
alarms can no longer outrank an opening. Fixing it properly means letting only
the Riyadh machine write health, which is a change to who owns the dataset.
*If never fixed: occasional false red marks in the app that clear themselves on
the next run from Riyadh.*

## Interface

**Predicted windows are not drawn.** The Season Bar has the legend slot and the
specification asks for hatched "متوقع" lanes. It needs previous cycles, and the
dataset has none of its own yet. *If never fixed: the bar shows what is known
and nothing more, which is the honest state.*

**`rawExcerpt` is stored and never shown.** Spec 3.2 keeps 400 characters "for
the user to read himself"; nothing renders it. *If never fixed: he opens the
page instead.*

**`verification.json` is deployed and never read.** 529 KB of audit trail in the
published bundle that the browser never fetches. *If never fixed: a slower first
load on mobile data.*

## Notifications

**A disappearance is recorded but never announced.** When a watched page stops
carrying its announcement the record is kept and flagged
`vanished_from_source` — the fix for the worst bug this file has held — and a
comment in `collect.ts` says the notifier can tell him about it. It cannot:
`decide()` has no branch for that flag, so the change is visible in the app and
silent on the phone. Left because it cannot cost an opportunity: he was told
when it opened, and the app shows the flag. *If never fixed: he learns a window
closed by opening the app rather than by being told.*

## Cost

**Input tokens are now the bill.** Output was seven-tenths of it and is now a
fifth: the cheap first pass answers in one word, and only pages that pass it are
asked the expensive question. What remains is the page text itself, sent twice
for a page that survives triage — once cheaply, once in full. Anthropic's prompt
caching would cut the system prompt's share of that; it was not done because the
system prompt is the smaller half and the change touches the one call that
decides everything. *If never fixed: the bill is a few cents a day rather than a
fraction of one.*

**Verdict memory only helps a page that returns to text it held before.** A page
that changes to something genuinely new every round is paid for every round —
correctly, because it is new. There is no saving left there without guessing.
*If never fixed: nothing; this is the cost of actually watching.*

## Operations

**Collection depends on one laptop.** GitHub's runners are refused by many
`.gov.sa` hosts, so the machine in Riyadh is the only one that can read them. It
now runs on battery, catches up a missed round, and writes a heartbeat the app
alarms on — but it is still one machine. *If never fixed: collection stops while
that machine is off, and the home screen says so in red after twelve hours.*

**Email is built and not configured.** `RESEND_API_KEY` and `NOTIFY_EMAIL` are
unset, so the digest channel is off. Nothing is lost by it: an undelivered
notice is queued and pushed by the next round that may send. *If never fixed:
one channel instead of two.*

**Untested hostile inputs.** A server that drips a response a byte at a time,
and a redirect to an internal address. The size cap and the timeout bound both,
but neither has been driven on purpose. *If never fixed: a slow source could
hold one of two concurrent fetch slots until its timeout.*
