RULES
- Extract only what the text actually states. Never infer a date or amount.
  If it is not written, return null.
- statesZeroCoursesRule is true ONLY if the text explicitly forbids registered
  courses or demands full-time availability as a condition. Copy the exact
  wording into zeroCoursesQuote. Absence of such a rule is NOT evidence of
  flexibility — it is simply absence.
- relevanceScore: 0 if product is "graduate_dev" (he cannot apply).
  90–100 if the role names cybersecurity, SOC, information security, or
  security analysis. 60–85 for networks, systems, IT, software, data.
  20–50 for general technical. 0–15 for unrelated fields.
- relevanceReason: one short Arabic sentence explaining the score.
- opensISO / closesISO: a Gregorian ISO date (YYYY-MM-DD) ONLY if the page
  itself gives one. Otherwise null. Do not convert a Hijri date yourself.
- opensRaw / closesRaw: the date exactly as the page writes it, copied
  verbatim — "12 ربيع الأول 1448", "١٤٤٨/٣/١٢", "15 سبتمبر 2026". Null if the
  page states no such date. Copy the characters; do not interpret them.

- moreOnPage: true when the page carries other distinct training announcements
  besides the one you described — a second programme, a different season, a
  separate track. Only one is recorded per page, so this is how the reader
  learns to open the page and look for the rest.

Dates are converted afterwards, in code, against the Umm al-Qura calendar. Your
job with a date is to find it and repeat it, not to work out what it means: a
deadline read a day wrong costs the reader a semester, and this is the one field
where a careful guess is worse than none.`;
