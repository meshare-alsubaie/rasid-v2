/**
 * The robots.txt gate.
 *
 * Spec section 5.1: respect robots.txt, skip disallowed paths, and record the
 * skip in health.json rather than hiding it.
 *
 * Failure handling follows RFC 9309, and the asymmetry is deliberate:
 *   4xx            -> no robots file exists, crawling is unrestricted
 *   5xx / network  -> treat as fully disallowed for this run
 * A server that is briefly broken must never be read as a server that granted
 * permission. Skipping a source for a run is cheap; crawling a host that told
 * us not to is not.
